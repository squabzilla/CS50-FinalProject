            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Elves typically live within forests, with some elven societies blending their buildings in within nature and giant forest-trees.
                Other elven societies will strive to build great elegant buildings deep within the heart of the forest -
                but in either case, it is very difficult to spot signs of elves from without the forest.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has often led to conflict with humans, who go to form a settlement in what they believe to be an uninhabited woodland.
            </p>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Elven culture makes great effort to blend their lives with nature - even those elves who build elegant buildings deep within the forest.
                Their desire to live in balance means they strive towards creating a stable population, giving them no need to expand their domain.
                However, despite living only within the heart of the great forests of the world, they claim dominion over all of it.
                Many humans have come into conflict with the elves over this, due to either not-knowing or not-caring about the elven claims to the forest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite their overall isolationist tendencies - or perhaps because of it -
                every elven society usually has a small number of elves not content to remain in their section of the world.
                Thus, elven traders and adventurers are frequently seen in small numbers all over the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Living as tall as humans, the most noteable aspects of elves are their pointy ears, and the lack of body hair aside from eyebrows and the hair atop their heads.
                Elves typically have very long hair, although this is attributed more to elven culture than anything else.
