            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Masters of magic, typically carrying magical tomes of knowledge with them, mages can be powerful adventurers.
                Yet not all mages are quick enough to effectively wield their magic in a fight,
                and it's not uncommon for a skilled mage to freeze in their first real battle.
                Adventurers are typically wary of mages until they've seen them in combat at least once,
                to be sure they can be counted on when they're needed the most.
