            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Dwarven societies are always found beneath the surface of the world, buidling their kingdoms under large hills or even larger mountains.
                Dwarves mine for metal and create fantastic metallury, but recently have found themselves in conflict with humans for some of the best mines.
            </p>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Dwarven societies are typically very structured and planned-out - the logistical difficulty of building their kingdoms underground forces this.
                This forces them to have relatively stable populations, similar to the elves - although for an entirely different reason.
                However, in antithesis to this planning and structure, dwarves regularly drink and break into chaotic brawls with each other.
                Many people - dwarves included - say it's the only way for them to work out their frustration over an otherwise incredibly-regimented life.
            </p>
            <h2>Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Dwarves are much shorter than elves and humans, although they typically weigh at least as much
                - dwarves often say they got "squished" living underground, but "there's just as much dwarf in a dwarf as a long-legs in a long-legs."
                Dwarves also grow incredibly long beards, and take great pride in growing and braiding them.
