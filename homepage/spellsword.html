            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Spellswords are those who have studied enough swordplay and magic to wield both of them proficiently in battle, and proceed to do so.
                Often arrogant, spellswords usually have at least some measure of skill to back themselves up.
                It is almost impossible to fake magical skill, and to those with real magical skill, they have no need to fake skill in swordplay as well.
                However, while talented, spellswords still have their limits, and more than one spellsword lost their life because they overestimated their power.
