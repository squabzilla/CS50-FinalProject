Bootstrap:
I followed documentation from bootstrap for creating the <select> boxes and the navigation <nav> tags on my website.

Javascript:
The 1-20 options in the level-select-dropdown, and the 1-18 options for the various different attributes,
are all generated by javascript code, which itself imports a few variables from a constant.js files to avoid "magic numbers"
and easily change them.
The navigation pane is also generated by nav.js so I can avoid copying it to every single page,
functionally it mostly just copies the same code into every page (although is does dynamically tell you what page yo're on).

10 HTML tags:
1	<div>                   which divides into sections, but really is initially used for the navigation pange
2	<p>                     which we use to divide things into paragraphs
3	<link>                  where we copied bootstrap stuff in, hardly counts
4	<script>                calls bootstrap, as well as a bunch of scripts I made
5	<a>                     for links (this is inside the javascript file)
6	<nav>                   taken from bootstrap, used to create the navigation pane on the top
7	<meta>                  tag: taken from bootstrap as part of the html-boiler-plate
8	<font> <i> <b>          for modifying font <i> tag: italics <b> tag: bold
9	<select><option>        from bootstrap, used to create select-boxes and options there-in
                            note that the <option> tag is located within different .js files
                            as I ran a script to auto-generate 1-18 or 1-20 dropdowns, instead of copy+paste 18-20 times
10	<form><input>           as an input box for creating a character name
11	<br>                    when I DO want a line break
12	<span>                  in my character.html page, used a lot to divide different sections WITHOUT a line-break
14	&#40; &#41; &#42; &#43; diferent symbols that might break html - specifically the ( + * ) symbols

CSS - 5 different selectors:
    body{}                  used for the main body on a page
    modifierName{}          creates a nice box for the 6 different modifier names, getting this JUST-right took a fair bit of work
    modifierNumber{}        creates a nice box to show the modifier numbers,  getting this JUST-right took a fair bit of work
    pageTitle {}            I probably could have used <h1> instead, but this class is for the on-screen title of each page
    basicPadding {}         has a little-bit of padding I added to various elements to make it line up more nicely.

Note: there is a 6th different selector of cust_label{}, but I'm not sure this functionally does anything.

CSS - 5 different properties:
    height                  used for vertial size of an element
    vertical-align          get things to allign better
    display: inline-block;  makes my display not be just like garbage
    border                  puts a border around something
    max-width: 105px;       sets the size of an element
    padding: 0.1em;         creates padding around an element, but more relevantly,
                            has a side-effect of vertically-alligning text
    text-align: center;     centers text in a box

While there are more properties than this is the CSS file, some of the properties were from templates
and I'm not 100% sure that they have a functional effect.
