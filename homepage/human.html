            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Humans can be found all over the surface of the world, although they tend to stay away from the underground.
                Human societies are almost always expanding, regularly putting them at conflict with the dwarves and the elves - and often other humans as well.
            </p>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Human culture is very fractured, with groups of humans often leaving to form a settlement elsewhere.
                Invariably, those settlers - regardless of their original intentions - will end up fracturing from their original society.
                This has led to a large amount of kingdoms and city-states all over the world, all fighting for their own self-interest and space in the world.
                Humans regularly end up in conflict with those near them - sometimes these conflicts end up just being battles of words, but other times they end in great bloodshed.
                The dwarves and the elves are always wary when a group of humans settles near their ancestral homes.
            </p>
            <h2>Physiology</h2>
            <p>
                Like everything else with humans, there is a lot of variety in their physiology,
                and any statements about them are better thought of as "general guidelines" rather then hard-and-fast rules.
                Their skin tone varies from very pale to very dark, seemingly dependent on how much sun the area they live in gets.
                They grow to about the same height as elves, with adult men typically growing facial hair (like dwarves),
                while adult women typically do not (similar to elves.)
