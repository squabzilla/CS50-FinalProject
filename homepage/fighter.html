            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Fighters are the most common type of adventurer, covering themselves in whatever armor they can find or afford, using a weapon to kill their foe.
                Fighters are often looked down on, simply because the bar to claim "I'm a figher" is incredibly low,
                and many wanna-be adventurers are just someone who picked up a club and declared themsef an adventurer.
                However, be wary of underestimating them - the best of them can defeat a rampaging minotaur without even drawing their sword.
