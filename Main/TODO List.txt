Create level 1 character of each class
attributes (str, dex, con, int, wis, cha) won't be included
    maybe add these if I have time, it won't be super hard?
class features, spells will be included
This means I'll be making a database of JUST level-1 features for initial version
(while I'm at it, I should make a level_one_spells.csv and import that one instead of all spells lol)

Only classes supportable at first: fighter, wizard
Fighter means we have to pick fighting style at lvl 1
Wizard means we have to pick spells at lvl 1
