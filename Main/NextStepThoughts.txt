okay so make database with list of features

just for ranger/fighter/wizard up to level 5

including custom subclasses I'm happy with

THEN WE GOTTA WRITE PYTHON CODE FOR CREATING AND LEVELING UP THESE CHARACTERS

python code will handle what options are available, some of them will just be hard-coded in python
preferably in a global variable, but still

need to open:
PC_Features.xlsx
from:
D:\GitProjects\CS50-FinalProject\Main\static\CSVs

also that's more of an excel-folder then CSV, but whatever, renaming it means changing code and I don't want to do that lol
