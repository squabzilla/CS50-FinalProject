okay so make database with list of features

just for ranger/fighter/wizard up to level 5

including custom subclasses I'm happy with

THEN WE GOTTA WRITE PYTHON CODE FOR CREATING AND LEVELING UP THESE CHARACTERS

python code will handle what options are available, some of them will just be hard-coded in python
preferably in a global variable, but still

need to open:
PC_Features.xlsx
from:
D:\GitProjects\CS50-FinalProject\Main\static\CSVs

also that's more of an excel-folder then CSV, but whatever, renaming it means changing code and I don't want to do that lol

okay so I made basic functionality for name, race, class, background
level starts at 1
do I have fucking anywhere to store attributes!?!? they ought to be in the list_characters table like DAMN
also need to add attributes to my CustomClass arg
honestly maybe just limit leveling up to level 2 lmao
    -> honestly, why not just make a level-1 character creator and call it a fucking day
    -> there will be more then enough there to qualify as a final project
I need a handler function I can just pass the new_pc variable to that will add relevant class features,
    and return a list of class-features we gotta choose from
        and another one for spells
        then I can make the next step of the character_creator to add features and spells
        need to add more weight to this fucking character class lmao
        then option to save it to db
NOTE: I need a create_new_character page that makes a brand-new new_pc variable, and passes it to character_creator
character_creator shouldn't make new_pc variables, so that way it doesn't wipe out existing ones
I can add a new_character button to the character creator, only shows up if everything is blank
