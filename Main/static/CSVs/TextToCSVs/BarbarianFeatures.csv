12,2,10,1,"Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.

16,4,11,0,"Primal Path"
17,4,10,1,"At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels."

36,12,10,1,"Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total."
37,13,11,0,"Primal Champion"
38,13,10,1,"At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds\. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4\. Your maximum for those scores is now 24."
39,14,11,0,"Path of the Berserker"
40,14,10,1,"For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end - that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being."
41,15,12,0,"Frenzy"
42,15,10,1,"Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage.

46,17,10,1,"Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence\. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you."
