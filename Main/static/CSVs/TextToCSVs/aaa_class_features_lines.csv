When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king."
97,35,0,2,"The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic."

With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

187,60,0,4,"You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list."
188,61,2,0,"Spellcasting Ability"
189,61,0,1,"Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability\. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one."
190,61,0,2,"<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus \+ your Wisdom modifier."
191,61,0,3,"<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus \+ your Wisdom modifier."
192,62,2,0,"Ritual Casting"
193,62,0,1,"You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared."
194,63,2,0,"Spellcasting Focus"
195,63,0,1,"You can use a druidic focus (see Equipment) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells."
196,64,1,0,"Wild Shape"
197,64,0,1,"Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest."
198,64,0,2,"Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table\. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed."
199,64,4,3,"Beast Shapes"
200,64,5,4,"Level_::_Max. CR_::_Limitations_::_Example"
201,64,6,5,"2nd_::_1/4_::_No flying or swimming speed_::_Wolf"
202,64,6,6,"4th_::_1/2_::_No flying speed_::_Crocodile"
203,64,6,7,"8th_::_1_::_-_::_Giant Eagle"
204,64,0,8,"You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down)\. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die."
205,64,0,9,"While you are transformed, the following rules apply:"
206,64,3,10,"Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them."
207,64,3,11,"When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious."
208,64,3,12,"You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast."
209,64,3,13,"You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense."
210,64,3,14,"You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form."
211,65,1,0,"Druid Circle"
212,65,0,1,"At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level."
213,66,1,0,"Ability Score Improvement"
214,66,0,1,"When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature."
215,67,1,0,"Timeless Body"
216,68,1,0,"Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year\. Beast Spells"
217,68,0,1,"Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components."
218,69,1,0,"Archdruid"
219,69,0,1,"At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times."
220,69,0,2,"Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape."
221,70,1,0,"Circle of the Land"
222,70,0,1,"The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites."
223,71,2,0,"Bonus Cantrip"
224,71,0,1,"When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice."
225,72,2,0,"Natural Recovery"
226,72,0,1,"Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest."
227,72,0,2,"For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots."
228,73,2,0,"Circle Spells"
229,73,0,1,"Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid\. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells."
230,73,0,2,"Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you."

On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses\. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours."

865,286,999,1,"At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-"
866,286,0,2,"level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind."
867,286,0,3,"<b>Your Spellbook</b>"
868,286,0,4,"The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library."
869,286,0,5,"<b>Copying a Spell into the Book.<b> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it."
870,286,0,6,"Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation."
871,286,0,7,"For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells."
872,286,0,8,"<b>Replacing the Book.</b> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell."
873,286,0,9,"If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal\. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place."
874,286,0,10,"<b>The Book's Appearance.</b> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap."
875,287,2,0,"Preparing and Casting Spells"
876,287,0,1,"The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest."
877,287,0,2,"You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots."
878,287,0,3,"For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells."
879,287,0,4,"You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list."
880,288,2,0,"Spellcasting Ability"
881,288,0,1,"Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one."
882,288,0,2,"<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus \+ your Intelligence modifier"
883,288,0,3,"<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus \+ your Intelligence modifier"
884,289,2,0,"Ritual Casting"
885,289,0,1,"You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared."
886,290,2,0,"Spellcasting Focus"

888,291,2,0,"Learning Spells of Ist Level and Higher"
889,291,0,1,"Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table\. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see Spellbook)."
890,292,1,0,"Arcane Recovery"
891,292,0,1,"You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher."
892,292,0,2,"For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots."
893,293,1,0,"Arcane Tradition"
894,293,0,1,"When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic."

896,294,1,0,"Ability Score Improvement"
897,294,0,1,"When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature."
898,295,1,0,"Spell Mastery"
899,295,0,1,"At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal."
900,295,0,2,"By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels."
901,295,0,3,"Signature Spells When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest."
902,295,0,4,"If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal."
903,296,1,0,"Tradition of Destruction"
904,296,0,1,"You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid\. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar\. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants."
905,297,2,0,"Destructive Savant"
906,297,0,1,"Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved."
907,298,2,0,"Sculpt Spells"
908,298,0,1,"Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save."
909,299,2,0,"Potent Cantrip"
910,299,0,1,"Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect\. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip."
911,300,2,0,"Empowered Evocation"
912,300,0,1,"Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast."
913,301,2,0,"Overchannel"
914,301,0,1,"Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell."
915,301,0,2,"The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity."
