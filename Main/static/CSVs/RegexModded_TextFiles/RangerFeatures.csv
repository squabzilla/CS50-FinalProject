Nature's Hunter###
Beginning at 1st level, Rangers are in tune with
the magic of nature, and are supernaturally skilled
at both tracking and hunting down their targets. You
know the Hunter's Mark and Druidcraft cantrips.

Well Travelled###
Rangers typically have a history of travelling all
over the world (or at least studying it.) Choose one
of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus
is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
the chosen skill.
You can also speak, read, and write two additional
languages.

Fighting Style###
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting
as your specialty. Choose one of the following
options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more
than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Archery#$#
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with
ranged weapons.

Defense#$#
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to
AC.

Dueling#$#
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand
and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
damage rolls with that weapon.

Two-Weapon Fighting#$#
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can
add your ability modifier to the damage of the
second attack.

Spellcasting###
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to
use the magical essence of nature to cast spells,
much as a druid does.

Spell Slots#$#
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To
cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal
friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell
slot available, you can cast animal friendship using
either slot.

Spells Known of Ist Level and Higher#$#
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from
the ranger spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table
shows when you learn more ranger spells of your
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new
spell of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the ranger spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the ranger
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability#$#
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger
spells, since your magic draws on your attunement
to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.
<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier.
<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier.

Spellcasting Focus#$#
You can use a druidic focus (see Equipment) as a
spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.

Ranger Archetype###
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive
to emulate, such as the Hunter. Your choice grants
you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and
15th level.

Primeval Awareness###
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and
expend one ranger spell slot to focus your
awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute
per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense
whether the following types of creatures are present
within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you
are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials,
dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This
feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or
number.

Ability Score Improvement###
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

Extra Attack###
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead
of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your
turn.

Alert Hunter###
Beginning at 6th level, you have advantage on all 
Pereption checks, and can't be surprised.
In addition, when you cast the Hunter's Mark cantrip,
it now lasts for up to 8 hours.

Land's Stride###
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You
can also pass through nonmagical plants without
being slowed by them and without taking damage
from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar
hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws
against plants that are magically created or
manipulated to impede movement, such those
created by the entangle spell.
Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try
to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid
surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall
and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to
Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain
there without moving or taking actions. Once you
move or take an action or a reaction, you must
camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

Vanish###
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as
a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be
tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to
leave a trail.

Feral Senses###
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help
you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a
