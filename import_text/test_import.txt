Rage@
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
aren't wearing heavy armor:
. You have advantage on Strength checks and
Strength saving throws.
. When you make a melee weapon attack using
Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as
shown in the Rage Damage column of the
Barbarian table.
. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you canʼt cast them or
concentrate on them while raging.
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you
are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and
you havenʼt attacked a hostile creature since your
last turn or taken damage since then. You can also
end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
Once you have raged the number of times shown
for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before
you can rage again.
Unarmored Defense@
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor
Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your
Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still
gain this benefit.
